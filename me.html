<h3 style=color:black> Which is short for Takumi Joseph Plunkett. Takumi means ocean-pioneer in Japanese, and Joseph is my dad's name, and his dad's name and his dad's name, so on and so forth. My family name Plunkett originates from Ireland. I am 14 years old and is from the US and Japan. In my entire life I have lived in Japan, China, USA, and here. I enjoy swimming, games, D&D, and math. As my name implies, I am half Japanese-American. <h3>
